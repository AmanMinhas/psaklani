Priya promptly started the treatment, and there was a marked improvement in Dennis\' condition. Unfortunately, in less than 2 months, he was mowed down by a dog hater (who had earlier threatened to kill our dogs) else I\'m sure he would have recovered in time. We are grateful to Priya for her constant support and help during those difficult times, and even now. I also consulted her for problems with another dog, and benefited from her advice. I would strongly recommend her services to anyone who is in need for a holistic healing for their animals."',
